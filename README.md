# hack-assembler

An assembler for the Hack virtual machine, as specified in the book
_The Elements of Computing Systems_. I followed the machine specifications,
but not the exact strategy laid out for implementation.

## Usage

Clone & build:

```
$ git clone [etc] && cd hack-assembler
$ shards build
```

This will compile an assembler CLI to `./bin/hasm` which you can
put wherever you prefer.
